 * This is the documentation of RBDL, the Rigid Body Dynamics Library. The
 * library contains highly efficient code for both forward and inverse
 * dynamics for kinematic chains and branched models. It includes:
 *
 * \li Recursive Newton Euler Algorithm (RNEA)
 * \li Composite Rigid Body Algorithm (CRBA)
 * \li Articulated Body Algorithm (ABA).
 
 * Furthermore it contains code for forward and inverse \ref
 * kinematics_group "kinematics", computations of Jacobians, \ref
 * constraints_group "constraints" for contact and collision handling, and
 * closed loop models. \link RigidBodyDynamics::Model Models \endlink can
 * be loaded from Lua scripts or URDF files. The code and API is heavily
 * inspired by the pseudo code of the book "Rigid Body Dynamics Algorithms"
 * of <a href="http://royfeatherstone.org" target="_parent">Roy
 * Featherstone</a>.
 
 * The code has no external dependencies but for optimal performance it is
 * advised to use version 3 of the <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/"
 * target="_parent">Eigen</a> math library. More information about it can
 * be found here: <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/"
 * target="_parent">http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/</a>. The Eigen3 library
 * must be obtained and installed separately.
 *
 * \note This library is free and published under a very liberal \ref
 * license "license". If you use it in scientific work we would greatly 
 * appreciate a citation as described \ref citation "here".

 * <ul>
 * <li>05. Mai 2022: New release 3.2.0:
 *   <ul>
 *     <li> Merging RBDL and RBDL-ORB </li>
 *   </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>30 September 2021: New release 3.1.3:
 *   <ul>
 *     <li> Casadi Math Backend added support for tanh function. </li>
 *   </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>13 August 2021: New release 3.1.0:
 *   <ul>
 *     <li> Added support for rbdl-casadi, as an additional version of the rbdl library.
 *     It may be installed on the system in parallel to rbdl.</li>
 *     <li> Added system install of cmake config files, so that projects building on rbdl do not
 *     need to provide their own FindRBDL.cmake files anymore.</li>
 *   </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>02 May 2018: New release 2.6.0:
 *   <ul>
 *     <li> Added support for closed-loop models by replacing Contacts API by a new
 *       Constraints API. Loop constraints can be stabilized using Baumgarte
 *       stabilization. Special thanks to Davide Corradi for this contribution!</li>
 *     <li> New constraint type CustomConstraint: a versatile interface to define
 *       more general types of constraints (e.g. time dependent), contributed by
 *       Matthew J. Millard.</li>
 *     <li> New joint type JointTypeHelical that can be used for screwing motions
 *       (translations and simultaneous rotations), contributed by Stuart Anderson.</li>
 *     <li> Added support to specify external forces on bodies on constrained forward
 *       dynamics and NonlinearEffects() (contributed by Matthew J. Millard)</li>
 *     <li> Changed Quaternion multiplication behaviour for a more standard
 *       convention: multiplying q1 (1,0,0,0) with q2 (0,1,0,0) results now in
 *       (0,0,1,0) instead of the previous (0,0,-1,0).</li>
 *     <li> Removed Model::SetFloatingBaseBody(). Use JointTypeFloatingBase instead.</li>
 *     <li> LuaModel: extended specification to support ConstraintSets.</li>
 *   </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>28 April 2016: New release 2.5.0:
 *   <ul>
 *     <li> Added an experimental Cython based Python wrapper of RBDL. The API is
 *       very close to the C++ API. For a brief glimpse of the API see 
 *       \ref PythonExample "Python Example"</li>
 *     <li> Matthew Millard added CustomJoints which allow to create different joint
 *       types completely by user code. They are implemented as proxy joints for
 *       which their behaviour is specified using virtual functions.</li>
 *     <li> Added CalcMInvTimesTau() that evaluates multiplication of the inverse of
 *       the joint space inertia matrix with a vector in O(n) time.</li>
 *     <li> Added JointTypeFloatingBase which uses TX,TY,TZ and a spherical joint for
 *       the floating base joint.</li>
 *     <li> Loading of floating base URDF models must now be specified as a third
 *       parameter to URDFReadFromFile() and URDFReadFromString()</li>
 *     <li> Added the URDF code from Bullet3 which gets used when ROS is not found.
 *       Otherwise use the URDF libraries found via Catkin.</li>
 *     <li> Added CalcPointVelocity6D, CalcPointAcceleration6D, and CalcPointJacobian6D
 *       that compute both linear and angular quantities</li>
 *     <li> Removed Model::SetFloatingBase (body). Use a 6-DoF joint or
 *       JointTypeFloatingBase instead.</li>
 *     <li> Fixed building issues when building DLL with MSVC++.</li>
 *   </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>20 March 2016: New bugfix version 2.4.1:
 *   <ul>
 *     <li> <b>critical</b>: fixed termination criterion for
 *     InverseKinematics(). The termination criterion would be evaluated too
 *     early and thus report convergence too early. This was reported
 *     independently by Kevin Stein, Yun Fei, and Davide Corradi. Thanks
 *     for the reports!</li>
 *     <li> <b>critical</b>: fixed CompositeRigidBodyAlgorithm() when using
 *     spherical joints (thanks to Sébastien Barthélémy for
 *     reporting!)</li>
 *     </li>
 *   </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>23 February 2015: New version 2.4.0:
 *   <ul>
 *    <li>Added sparse range-space method ForwardDynamicsContactsRangeSpaceSparse() and ComputeContactImpulsesRangeSpaceSparse()</li>
 *    <li>Added null-space method ForwardDynamicsContactsNullSpace() and ComputeContactImpulsesNullSpace()</li>
 *    <li>Renamed ForwardDynamicsContactsLagrangian() to ForwardDynamicsContactsDirect() and ComputeContactImpulsesLagrangian() to ComputeContactImpulsesDirect()</li>
 *    <li>Renamed ForwardDynamicsContacts() to ForwardDynamicsContactsKokkevis()</li>
 *    <li>Removed/Fixed CalcAngularMomentum(). The function produced wrong values. The functionality has been integrated into CalcCenterOfMass().</li>
 *    <li>CalcPointJacobian() does not clear the argument of the result anymore.  Caller has to ensure that the matrix was set to zero before using this function.</li>
 *    <li>Added optional workspace parameters for ForwardDynamicsLagrangian() to optionally reduce memory allocations</li>
 *    <li>Added JointTypeTranslationXYZ, JointTypeEulerXYZ, and JointTypeEulerYXZ which are equivalent to the emulated multidof joints but faster.</li>
 *    <li>Added optional parameter to CalcCenterOfMass() to compute angular momentum.</li>
 *    <li>Added CalcBodySpatialJacobian()</li>
 *    <li>Added CalcContactJacobian()</li>
 *    <li>Added NonlinearEffects()</li>
 *    <li>Added solving of linear systems using standard Householder QR</li>
 *    <li>LuaModel: Added LuaModelReadFromLuaState()</li>
 *    <li>URDFReader: Fixed various issues and using faster joints for floating base models</li>
 *    <li>Various performance improvements</li>
 *  </ul>
 * </li>
